        <p>Ian Ditsch. And a little bit about yourself. 
        I live in Grand Rapids, Michigan with my wife and two toddlers. 
        We moved here about a year and a half ago (never again moving with two toddlers, 
        unless God works a mighty miracle!).
        I've always had a high aptitude, gifting, and passion for technology, electronics, and computers.
        I have been drawn to writing code and web development, and have a high gifting and passion from 
        God to create a health app (whole health: spirit, soul, and body), and a Bible app, that 
        converges all the knowledge, wisdom and understanding He has brought me and make it available 
        and understandable for anyone, and utilizing technology for prophecy and the power of God, 
        taking the tech and media mountain for God, calling people back to Him, 
        and bringing His kingdom.</p>
